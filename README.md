A PyQt5 UI for reading/writing custom Ultimaker NFC Material Spools

This GUI/set of scripts is based on some classes written by @gandy92 here: https://gist.github.com/gandy92/a7eef12009045f7b3fc01d778c3b79a7

I have added to his work but designing a small GUI, adding some more functions for reading existing/editing spools, and for automatically looking up materials from the Ultimaker Cura slicer.

Please also see: https://community.ultimaker.com/topic/19648-readwrite-nfc-tags/ for its purpose.
